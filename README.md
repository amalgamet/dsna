Are you curious how to write more performant, maintainable code? Are you self-taught and/or intimidated by computer science topics? Then take a look at some of these examples! We'll walk through some high-level things, including:

* Big-O notation, i.e. how to evaluate time- and space-complexity of code
* Common data structure implementations, and how to apply them in everyday situations
* Common algorithms, and how to apply them to impress your friends and colleagues
* Test cases to understand the underlying mechanics in a semantic way

Fortifying your knowledge of data structures and algorithms is essential if you're looking to thrive as a software engineer. The examples here aren't necessarily deep dives, but you should get a good sense of how to apply these principles to your code.
